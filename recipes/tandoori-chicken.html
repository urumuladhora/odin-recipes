        <p class="about-recipe">Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home. 
        Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob, and a cucumber salad.</p>

        <h3 class="directions">Directions</h3>
        <li>
            <ol>Gather all Ingredients</ol>
            <ol>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.</ol>
            <ol>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.</ol>
            <ol>Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).</ol>
            <ol>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.</ol>
            <ol>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F</ol>
            <ol>Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.</ol>
